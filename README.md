# Makefile Commands

## Quick Start

- **Docker** and **docker-compose** must be installed.
- For the `make collect` command, you **must** set the `GITHUB_TOKEN` environment variable (for GitHub GraphQL access).

Example (Linux/Mac):

```sh
export GITHUB_TOKEN=your_token_here
```

### MIN\_R\_S Parameter

The `MIN_R_S` parameter defines the cutoff value for the correlation coefficient. If you set MIN_R_S below 0.35, the resulting categories may include warnings for which groups are not defined. For such warnings, the category will be marked as "other". To add categories for additional warnings, edit the files phpstan_cat.json, psalm_cat.json, and phan_cat.json in the "results" directory.

By default:

- `MIN_R_S` is set to `0.35`.

You can override this default when running the `make results` command:

```sh
make results MIN_R_S=<your_threshold>
```

For example, to include only values with r_s â‰¥ 0.4:

```sh
make results MIN_R_S=0.4
```


## Main Commands

| Command     | Description                                                                                           |
| ----------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **results** | Generate statistics from collected data (`results.py`). Use the `MIN_R_S` parameter to filter output. |
| **collect** | Run the main data collection script (`collect.py`) inside the container. **Requires GITHUB\_TOKEN**.  |
| **shell**   | Open an interactive bash shell in the container (for manual work or debugging).                       |
| **build**   | Build the Docker image with all required dependencies.                                                |

## Usage

Example command usage:

```sh
export GITHUB_TOKEN=your_token_here   # Required for make collect
make results                          # Generate statistics from results/data.json
make collect                          # Collect the main analysis (requires GITHUB_TOKEN) and create results/data.json
make shell                            # Open a bash shell in the container for debug
make build                            # Build the Docker image
```
